# Employee-Management-System
An easy to use applications for managers to review, store, modify, and delete their employees data in one place

This application is a showcase of some of my PHP, SQL, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS web developement capabilities

A very user friendly application for managers to efficiently interact with a database filled with their employees featuring:
<ul>
  <li> Secure login and account information storage and function (passwords hashed, and upon logout all session details are destroyed)</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Recognition of wrong password vs. non existant unregistered username</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <li> Abilities to view all of the managers and employees that belong to the same company</li>
  <br>
  <li> Using well structured tables modals and forms, users can:</li>
  <ul>
    <li> Add new employees</li>
    <li> Edit any small detail of any desired employee in their company</li></li>
    <li> Remove employees from the systems</li>
    <li> Add managers to the company, that can login themselves and view the same employees</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <li> All of which occur instantaneously on both the users end and the database</li>
  <li> Thorough error checking and efficiency testing</li>
  <li> Elegant usage of colours, CSS Styling, and interactive buttons/modals
</ul>
